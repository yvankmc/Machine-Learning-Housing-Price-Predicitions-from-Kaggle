# 🏠 Housing Price Prediction using Decision Trees & Random Forests

This project focuses on predicting house sale prices using tree-based machine learning models, specifically Decision Tree Regression and Random Forest Regression, based on the Kaggle Housing Prices dataset and their Intro To Machine Learning Course. Also, note that there were more edits made, but overtime kaggle pushed it into one cell. This is with the exception of the decision tree model as random forest was the smarter approach because of its higher prediction accuracy.

# 🎯 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to:

Build model to predict housing prices

Apply Decision Trees and Random Forests

Compare model behavior and performance

Generate final house price predictions from cleaned and processed data

# 📂 Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of residential housing data with features describing:

🏡 Property structure and size

🏗️ Build quality and condition

📊 Numerical and categorical variables

The target variable is:

SalePrice – the final sale price of each house

# 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

Data was already cleaned by Kaggle

# 🌳 Decision Tree Regression

Learn nonlinear relationships between features and sale price

Capture feature-based splits in housing data

Serve as a baseline tree-based model

Model training

Predictions on housing data

Evaluation of model behavior

# 🌲 Random Forest Regression

Reducing overfitting through ensemble averaging

Improving prediction stability and accuracy

Train on the prepared dataset

Generate final predictions

# 📊 Model Evaluation

Model accuracy evaluated using Mean Absolute Error  

# 🧾 Final House Price Predictions

Applies the trained Random Forest model to unseen data

Generates predicted house prices

This represents the final output of the project.
